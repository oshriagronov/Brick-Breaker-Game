## About

This project is a classic Brick Breaker game developed in Java. The game was built from the ground up, utilizing the javax.swing and java.awt libraries to handle the graphical user interface and event-driven programming.<br/>
This implementation demonstrates a solid understanding of object-oriented principles and game loop mechanics, providing a fun and engaging user experience while showcasing the capabilities of Java for desktop applications.

### Key features

- Parameters are customizable: ball speed, life points, Screen resolution.
- Life points system.
- Score system.

## Future plans
 The recently completed overhaul provides a solid foundation for version 2.0, which will include:
 - A more modern design
 - An option to reset the game after winning or losing
 - Possible bonuses that appear randomly when bricks are destroyed
 - And more!

## Technologies Used

- Java SE17.
- Utilities library - Scanner.
- Swing library.
- AWT library.
- Javax library.
- Io library.
