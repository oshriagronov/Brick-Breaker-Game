### Known issues
* Sometimes if you hit the brick sides the ball will be returned like it was hit the bottom of the brick.
* The only way to replay the game is to close the game and run again.
* The number of bricks depends on screen resolution(the higher the resolution the more bricks will be and vice versa).
