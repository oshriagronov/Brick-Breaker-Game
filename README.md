## About

This project is a classic Brick Breaker game developed in Java. The game was built from the ground up, utilizing the javax.swing and java.awt libraries to handle the graphical user interface and event-driven programming.<br/>
This implementation demonstrates a solid understanding of object-oriented principles and game loop mechanics, providing a fun and engaging user experience while showcasing the capabilities of Java for desktop applications.

### Key features

- Life points system.
- Score system.

## Technologies Used

- Java SE17.
- Utilities library - Scanner.
- Swing library.
- AWT library.
- Javax library.
- Io library.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- Linux, MacOS or Windows
- IDE with java

### Installation

---

1. **Clone and enter the Magnetron repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/oshriagronov/brick-breaker && cd brick-breaker
   ```

2. **Open the brick-breaker folder in your IDE**

3. **Run Gamemanager.java file!**

### Known issues

- Sometimes if you hit the brick sides the ball will be returned like it was hit the bottom of the brick.
- The only way to replay the game is to close the game and run again.
- The number of bricks depends on screen resolution(the higher the resolution the more bricks will be and vice versa).
